🔬 The Academic and Professional (The Head)

🌟 Current Role & Mission

I am Sun Jiahong (Ryan), a Postdoctoral Researcher specializing in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) and Center for Eye and Vision Research (CEVR). My work centers on developing new algorithms for calling genetic variants and studying cancer evolution at single-cell level. I am also interested in a very new research field: AI virtual cell. I aim to translate complex biological datasets into actionable insights, particularly focusing on virtual cell modeling and disease mechanism discovery.

🧬 Research Focus & Expertise

- Omics Data Analysis: Expertise in WGS, single-cell DNA-seq, bulk RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data processing.
- Statistical Modeling: Advanced knowledge of Bayesian statistics, machine learning (supervised/unsupervised), and dimensionality reduction techniques.
- Computational Tools: Fluent in R (Tidyverse, Bioconductor) and Python (scikit-learn, PyTorch), with experience in cloud computing environments (AWS/GCP).
- Key Interest: Currently focused on studying genetic variations in cancers to find common cancer evolutionary patterns and risking factors.

🚀 What You'll Find Here

The bioinformatics section of this blog serves as a digital notebook for reproducible research. I share comprehensive tutorials, deep dives into statistical methods, and critiques of new tools. You'll find code and analysis for challenging projects related to omics data and AI virtual cell models.

☕ The Personal and Curated (The Heart)

📚 Learning & Literacy

- Reading: I am an avid reader of classic literature, focusing on [Author or Genre]. My non-fiction interests revolve around cognitive science and the philosophy of language.
- English Learning: As an ESL speaker/lifelong learner, I share tips, resources, and reflections on improving fluency and professional communication.

🍳 Food & Fuel

- Approach to Food: My culinary philosophy mirrors my research: precise, experimental, and driven by data (i.e., ingredients ratios!). I focus on recipes that are high-nutrient, efficient for a busy schedule, and often inspired by [Cuisine Type].
