I am currently a PostDoctoral Fellow at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. My interests include developing new algorithms for calling genetic variants and studying cancer evolution at single-cell level, and constructing AI virtural cell.

I am maintaining this blog to record my daily working and learning, so I can review them in any time.
