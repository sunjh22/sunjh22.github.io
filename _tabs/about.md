Hi, I am Jiahong. I am currently a third-year PhD student under a collaborative scheme between [SUSTech](https://sustech.edu.cn) and [PolyU](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/).
My research interest includes whole-genome sequencing and copy number variations, single-cell DNA sequencing and tumor evolution.

I am a big fan of badminton, usually play it three or four times a week.

I find that many things I have learnt or understood begins to lose as time goes by, so I decide to open this blog to write down those things to help for future review.

I believe the process of acquiring knowledge is about learning, practicing and reviewing. A thousand miles begins with a single step.
