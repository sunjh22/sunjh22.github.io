    "text": "🔬 The Academic and Professional (The Head)\n🌟 Current Role & Mission\nI am Sun Jiahong (Ryan), a Postdoctoral Researcher specializing in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) and Center for Eye and Vision Research (CEVR). My work centers on developing new algorithms for calling genetic variants and studying cancer evolution at single-cell level. I am also interested in a very new research field: AI virtual cell. I aim to translate complex biological datasets into actionable insights, particularly focusing on virtual cell modeling and disease mechanism discovery.\n🧬 Research Focus & Expertise\n\nOmics Data Analysis: Expertise in WGS, single-cell DNA-seq, bulk RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data processing.\nStatistical Modeling: Advanced knowledge of Bayesian statistics, machine learning (supervised/unsupervised), and dimensionality reduction techniques.\nComputational Tools: Fluent in R (Tidyverse, Bioconductor) and Python (scikit-learn, PyTorch), with experience in cloud computing environments (AWS/GCP).\nKey Interest: Currently focused on studying genetic variations in cancers to find common cancer evolutionary patterns and risking factors.\n\n🚀 What You’ll Find Here\nThe bioinformatics section of this blog serves as a digital notebook for reproducible research. I share comprehensive tutorials, deep dives into statistical methods, and critiques of new tools. You’ll find code and analysis for challenging projects related to omics data and AI virtual cell models.\n☕ The Personal and Curated (The Heart)\n📚 Learning & Literacy\n\nReading: I am an avid reader of classic literature, focusing on [Author or Genre]. My non-fiction interests revolve around cognitive science and the philosophy of language.\nEnglish Learning: As an ESL speaker/lifelong learner, I share tips, resources, and reflections on improving fluency and professional communication.\n\n🍳 Food & Fuel\n\nApproach to Food: My culinary philosophy mirrors my research: precise, experimental, and driven by data (i.e., ingredients ratios!). I focus on recipes that are high-nutrient, efficient for a busy schedule, and often inspired by [Cuisine Type].\n\n🤝 Connect and Collaborate\n\nEmail: The best way to reach me is via email: Email\nGitHub: View my repositories and source code for the blog here: GitHub\nGoogle Scholar: For my formal publication list: Google Scholar\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "About three years ago, I built a blog website on Github using jekyll, now I want to re-start, so I asked Gemini 3 to help me. I followed its instructions and successfully built it.\n\n1. Archive previous site\n\nGo to your existing repository on GitHub.\nClick Settings -&gt; General.\nRename the repository to something like blog-archive-jekyll.\nCreate a new repository named sunjh22.github.io.\n\n\n\n2. Create new repository\n\nCreate a new repository named sunjh22.github.io.\nInitialize it with a README.md.\nGo to Settings &gt; Pages and set the “Source” to Deploy from a branch -&gt; main -&gt; /docs. (We will configure Quarto to render to a /docs folder).\n\n\n\n3. Download and install Quarto\nwget https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/releases/download/v1.8.26/quarto-1.8.26-linux-amd64.tar.gz\ntar -xzf quarto-1.8.26-linux-amd64.tar.gz\nln -s /home/sunjh/data/biosoft/quarto-1.8.26/bin/quarto ~/data/bin/\n\n\n4. Initialize the Project\ngit clone https://github.com/sunjh22/sunjh22.github.io.git\ncd sunjh22.github.io\nquarto create-project myblog --type website:blog\nmv myblog/* .\nmv myblog/.gitignore .\nrmdir myblog\n\n\n5. Configure for GitHub Pages\nEdit _quarto.yml, index.qmd and about.qmd. All the new posts should be under ‘posts/’ directory, make three sub-directories ‘posts/bioinfo’, ‘posts/life’ and ‘posts/daily’.\n\n\n6. Preview and Publish\n# Because the port restriction, preview function is not available now.\nquarto preview\n\n# Render the full site\nquarto render\n\n# Push to Github\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Initial commit\"\ngit push origin main\n\n\nBonus for git push\n\nCheck for existing SSH keys:\n\nls -al ~/.ssh\nIf you see id_ed25519.pub or id_rsa.pub, skip to step 3.\n\nGenerate a new SSH key:\n\nssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"your_email@example.com\"\n(Press Enter through all prompts to accept defaults).\n\nAdd the key to GitHub: Display your public key:\n\ncat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub\n# Or cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\nCopy the output (starts with ssh-ed25519…). Go to GitHub Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key. Paste the key and save.\n\nSwitch your repository to use SSH: Currently, your repo is looking for the HTTPS link. You need to point it to the SSH link.\n\n# Change remote URL from HTTPS to SSH\ngit remote set-url origin git@github.com:sunjh22/sunjh22.github.io.git\n\n# Verify it changed\ngit remote -v\n# Should show: origin  git@github.com:sunjh22/sunjh22.github.io.git (fetch)\n\nPush:\n\ngit push origin main\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "section": "",
    "text": "ATAC-seq is used to find genomewide open regions that any protein could bind, including transcription binding site, promoters and enhancers (non-specific). Use hyperactive Tn5 transposase on unfixed nuclei, typically requires 500-50,000 cells as input, it is simple and fast.\nChIP-seq is used to find the binding site of specific proteins (e.g transcription factors) or screen the specific histone modifications by specific antibodies (specific). Use specific antibody against the protein/modification of interest on crosslinked (fixed) chromatin, typically requires 1-10 million cells, it is more labor-intensive.\nAs seen in ?@fig-histone, there are six common histone modifications. \n?@fig-antibody shows the current best-practice panel (what most big consortia and top labs use in 2024–2025) for mapping histone modifications. \n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
