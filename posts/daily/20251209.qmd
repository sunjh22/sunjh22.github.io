ATAC-seq is used to find genomewide open regions that any protein could bind, including transcription binding site, promoters and enhancers (non-specific). Use hyperactive Tn5 transposase on unfixed nuclei, typically requires 500-50,000 cells as input, it is simple and fast.
ChIP-seq is used to find the binding site of specific proteins (e.g transcription factors) or screen the specific histone modifications by specific antibodies (specific). Use specific antibody against the protein/modification of interest on crosslinked (fixed) chromatin, typically requires 1-10 million cells, it is more labor-intensive.

As seen in @fig-histone, there are six common histone modifications.

@fig-antibody shows the current best-practice panel (what most big consortia and top labs use in 2024–2025) for mapping histone modifications.
