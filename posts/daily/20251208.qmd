About three years ago, I built a blog website on Github using jekyll, now I want to re-start, so I asked Gemini 3 to help me. I followed its instructions and successfully built it.

# 1. Archive previous site
1. Go to your existing repository on GitHub.
2. Click Settings -> General.
3. Rename the repository to something like blog-archive-jekyll.
4. Create a new repository named sunjh22.github.io.

# 2. Create new repository
1. Create a new repository named sunjh22.github.io.
2. Initialize it with a README.md.
3. Go to Settings > Pages and set the "Source" to Deploy from a branch -> main -> /docs. (We will configure Quarto to render to a /docs folder).

# 3. Download and install Quarto
```bash
wget https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/releases/download/v1.8.26/quarto-1.8.26-linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -xzf quarto-1.8.26-linux-amd64.tar.gz
ln -s /home/sunjh/data/biosoft/quarto-1.8.26/bin/quarto ~/data/bin/
```

# 4. Initialize the Project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sunjh22/sunjh22.github.io.git
cd sunjh22.github.io
quarto create-project myblog --type website:blog
mv myblog/* .
mv myblog/.gitignore .
rmdir myblog
```

# 5. Configure for GitHub Pages
Edit `_quarto.yml`, `index.qmd` and `about.qmd`. All the new posts should be under 'posts/' directory, make three sub-directories 'posts/bioinfo', 'posts/life' and 'posts/daily'.

# 6. Preview and Publish
```bash
# Because the port restriction, preview function is not available now.
quarto preview

# Render the full site
quarto render

# Push to Github
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main
```

# Bonus for git push
1. Check for existing SSH keys:
```bash
ls -al ~/.ssh
If you see id_ed25519.pub or id_rsa.pub, skip to step 3.
```

2. Generate a new SSH key:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
(Press Enter through all prompts to accept defaults).

3. Add the key to GitHub:
Display your public key:
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# Or cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Copy the output (starts with ssh-ed25519...).
Go to GitHub Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key.
Paste the key and save.

4. Switch your repository to use SSH: Currently, your repo is looking for the HTTPS link. You need to point it to the SSH link.
```bash
# Change remote URL from HTTPS to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:sunjh22/sunjh22.github.io.git

# Verify it changed
git remote -v
# Should show: origin  git@github.com:sunjh22/sunjh22.github.io.git (fetch)
```

5. Push:
```bash
git push origin main
```
