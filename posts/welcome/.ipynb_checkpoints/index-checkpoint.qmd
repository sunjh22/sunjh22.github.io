About three years ago, I built a blog website on Github using jekyll, now I want to re-start, so I asked Gemini 3 to help me. I followed its instructions and successfully built it.

# 1. Archive previous site

1. Go to your existing repository on GitHub.
2. Click Settings -> General.
3. Rename the repository to something like blog-archive-jekyll.
4. Create a new repository named username.github.io.
